# Spotify-Sleep-Timer-for-Mac
Just a sleep timer for Spotify on MacOS since there isn't one out there already.
NOTE: The first time you use the app, at the time set for the timer, it will not pause and instead will ask for permission to do so. To start off, I recommend putting 0.5 in for the first time just to set it up.
The app also works as a sleep timer for your phone's Spotify if you have spotify open on your computer.
